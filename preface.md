**It’s easier to follow one’s own ideas, reflect upon and pursue than build someone else's.** 

This book puts the reader in the centre of his or her daily interactions and observations. The book doesn’t attempt to impart any second hand knowledge, but it attempts to voice the many ideas the reader might already have and relate to. Our hope is that this book will act as a catalyst for the reader in identifying a sweet spot among the plethora of ideas around AI. 

The authors who have conceptualized this book (Madhu and Ranga) have contemplated much on some of the the ideas and believe this process may be useful to others who have a deep sense of curiosity in the AI space. The intention of this book is to encourage the reader in coming up with an idea close to the heart and imagine how AI could help in shaping out a solution. 

This book looks at things in everyday life and sees an opportunity to connect with the readers. The chapters are self contained i.e. the reader can pick up any chapter in any random order based on interest and follow through how AI may play a role in bringing that idea into the realm of reality. 

Over time, we would like to cover these various ideas in *ai4mylife* in different formats - podcasts, youtube videos, blogs, tweets etc. With the support of an engaged community, it may not be preposterous to assume that this book will grow like a popular TV series with many episodes per season and multiple seasons.

# I want to Taste it Fresh - @madhucharis

# My Thoughts

We often have food at our favourite restaurant and bakery. One thing that we wonder is - did we eat it fresh? 

What if AI can help see and understand and answer our doubts and help us select the food, so we are both - socially and personally satisfied.

I need to eat fresh bread. That said, I don't feel like asking the same as he is my favourite baker, but I want an assurance.

I have a camera on my mobile. Can I use it to grab a picture and let an app take a look at it and tell me whether it's fresh or not ? 

Luckily it can give a score of how likely it might be fresh and also have additonal information on how it will taste and how it may feel.

#How AI can help Solve it  

#Space Matter’s  
We have grown up with Ad’s and we often get annoyed with the disruption.  
But we always like the ticker at the bottom of the screen showing us some useful information about stocks.  
We like notifications.   
But we often wondered what screen we are reading has a lot of unused space and some useful information that can be shown?  
It can be a TV, it can be email or it can be a browser, but what if contextual information is shown?  

#Digital Wellness  
We often engage in Social Media often enough to see the same messages, same emotions.  
It might be very useful if the design can be centred around “entropy”.  
If there is a reply “Congratulations” it can be clustered around that emotion and it can allow the user to suppress further notifications as people tend to congratulate.  
While it can bring up a different Note. 
A time saved is a breath gifted.  

#Help me Learn in my Way  
It often goes we respect the Teachers for they followed the way we thought, paused us and made us see from where we approached.   
What if such a  teacher is there for everyone.  
This is exactly what NLP can bring.

#Did I forget about my Mom?
We always want to take care of parents' well being that said “Modern” life has stolen every moment. What if an everyday experience can be brought via AI, where a gentle voice reminds mom to take the medicine and she acknowledges using the same. A feeling of completeness is worth it.

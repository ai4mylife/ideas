# About Us

This initiative called **ai4mylife** is conceptualized by long time friends, *Madhu (Madhusoodhana Chari)* and *Ranga (Rangaprasad Sampath)* who over the past several years have chatted over the use, misuse and abuse of Artificial Intelligence. They seem to have now arrived at a point where they realize that a community based collaborative approach would help compile the ideas that each one of us has around how AI should help in our daily lives.

*Ranga* is an engineer by education and a technologist by training. He has spent over a decade and a half honing up my skills in Networking Technology â€“ bits and bytes, packets and buffers, protocols and features, switches and routers, wired and wireless.
From that same spirit of a connected world, he created **You+AI** which is an initiative to connect Humans (You) in various endeavors with Artificial Intelligence (AI). One of the first initiatives of You+AI has been the You+AI Podcast which is a show where Ranga speaks with healthcare professionals and the conversation explores where AI may drive the most impact. All the 15 episodes of Season 1 are available @ [youplusai.com](https://youplusai.com/).

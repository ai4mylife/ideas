# My Want
I want to connect with my friends, family, and connect with them when they are available. 


# My Behavior
I am Jeevan. 
I feel life is changing fast for all of us. 
That said I feel I have to make efforts to maintain the human touch and human connection and be for each other.


# The question that haunts me!
I dont feel like disturbing my people,  
if they are at work, with their childeren, taking care of their parensts, with thier spouse. 
I don't want to intrude in thier privacy.. but how can I find a frinedly sweet spot to reach out to them.

## When should I reach?

# What I see vs. what others see
I choose the best from my memory or past history of when I have spoken to my people. 

That said, I know people are generally very polite or accomodative and rather speak up to me even if I were disturnign them. Sometme they say will get back.

Don’t get me wrong - I don;t intend to disturb but wanted to connet causllay!

# What may be happening behind-the scenes?

There could be many reasons - some that could use a fix and others beyond any fix.

## What could use a Fix
- I may not know what all times is more apt to reach out per person basis.
- I am probably picking to connect based on my availability and my rememberance or feel.
- I repeatedly try to reach out unaware of best time of my friends time to connect with.
- I don’t have a good sense of memory for every person to connect with especially a larger circle of friends from years.
- There is no one available to give me recommendations on when to reach out whom.

OR 
## What is beyond any Fix
- I am really not sure whether the other person wants to really catch up.
- I am just approaching to catchup with people withs ame thinking over and over again.

# My Need

I badly need a caring assistant who can recommend me with clarity and awareness what would be best personnalied time to connect with social circles.




# I’ve heard there’s this thing called Artificial Intelligence.

## I am your AI assistant, the name is Frido!

Tell me about all the people you have. 
Privately share your calendar or leave me speech notes of when you like to connect. 
Also tell me when you can't really be there.

You may also confide in me how you felt talking to your firend when you connected based on my suggestion. 
If it’s happened that they share about their context like meetting , travel, familiy time, I will remeber it for you, you may tell me that too.
Also ask whether they also will like to have me?

Stay with me for a few days and help me be your buddy. I will soon be able to help you when you need me the most.


# The AI assistant will now see you!

Frido - So, it’s been a sometime weeks that I have been learning about you. Let me try and help you today with your choice of whom to connect.

Jeevan - So, whats in your mind who to say a friendly hi and when?
Frido - Ravi. Remeber he had called you coule of times and have asked about his dress. 


Jeevan - Thats a great reminder, Go on, tell me more.
Frido - Where are you headed today?
Jeevan - I am going to a wedding anniversary of my office colleague.
Frido - Hmm, will there be more of your office colleagues there?
Jeevan - Yes, of course.

Frido - In that case, perhaps you can call your friend Raju as he works on night shift and wakes up at noon. I remember both had a nice time talking relaxed last time.
Jeevan - Huh! You remember that? Nice suggestion.
Frido - Sure and I would recommend confrerence call with another friend Prasanna, who also seems to be off this week and his frido told he is available.
Jeevan - Oh, I totally forgot about that. Sweet! Thank you Frido!

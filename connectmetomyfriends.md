# My Want
I want to connect with my friends, family and connect with them when they are available. 


# My Behavior
I am Jeevan. 
I feel life is changing fast for all of us. 
That said, I feel I have to make efforts to maintain the human touch and human connection and be there when needed for each other.


# The question that haunts me!
How can I reach out to my fellow humans i.e. friends, fanmily, acquaintances but yet not be seen as someone who is disturbing them?

I dont feel like disturbing them if they are busy at work or with their childeren or taking care of their parensts, with their spouse etc. 

I don't want to intrude their privacy, yet I want to reach out when they may be most available.

## When should I reach?

# What I see vs. what others see
I choose the best from my memory or past history of when I have spoken to my people. 

That said, I know people are generally very polite or accommodative and speak with me rather than hang up. Sometimes they politely say they will get back.

Don’t get me wrong - I don't intend to disturb them but want to connect casually!

# What may be happening behind-the scenes?

There could be many reasons - some that could use a fix and others beyond any fix.

## What could use a Fix
- I may not know what all times is more apt to reach out per person basis.
- I am probably picking to connect based on my availability and my rememberance or feel.
- I repeatedly try to reach out unaware of best time of my friends time to connect with.
- I don’t have a good sense of memory for every person to connect with especially a larger circle of friends from years.
- There is no one available to give me recommendations on when to reach out whom.

OR 
## What is beyond any Fix
- Perhaps the other person does not really want to catch up with me.
- I am just approaching people with the same thinking over and over again.

# My Need

I badly need a caring assistant who can recommend me with clarity and awareness what would be the best times to connect with people in one's social circles.


# I’ve heard there’s this thing called Artificial Intelligence.

What can AI do?

## I am your AI assistant, the name is Frido!

Tell me about all the people you have in your social circles. Leave me speech notes of when you would like to connect and how often you would want to connect with each person. 
Show me your calendar to give an idea of your availability to connect during the week.
Do let me know how you felt the last time you connected with each of these people.
If it happens that they share about their what they are going to be doing in the coming week or month like meetting, travel, familiy time etc. do let me know so that I will remeber it for you.
If you like me very much, do refer me to your close friend as well.
Stay with me for a few days and help me be your buddy. I will soon be able to help you when you need me the most.


# The AI assistant will now see you!

Frido - So, it’s been a few weeks that I have been learning about you. Let me try and help you today with your choice of whom to connect.

Jeevan - So, whats in your mind -  who should I say a friendly hi to and when?
Frido - Ravi. Remember he had called you a couple of times and asked you about some clothes that he was wearing. 
Jeevan - Thats a great reminder, thank you.



Frido - Where are you headed today?
Jeevan - I am going to a wedding anniversary of my office colleague.
Frido - Hmm, will there be more of your office colleagues there?
Jeevan - Yes, of course.
Frido - In that case, perhaps you can call your friend Raju as he works on night shift and wakes up at noon. I remember you both had a nice time talking the last time that left you much relaxed.
Jeevan - Huh! You remember that? Nice suggestion.
Frido - Sure and I would recommend a confrerence call with another friend Prasanna, who also seems to be off this week and I learnt from my trusted clone that he may welcome this connect.
Jeevan - Oh, I totally forgot about that. Sweet! Thank you Frido!
Frido - Have a lovely time! Don’t forget to tell me what your friends said.

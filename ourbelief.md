We believe in “Original” Ideas emerging from everyone for they are both authentic and will have entropy. That's what constantly shapes our community and life experiences. At first sight it will often sound like someone would have already thought about it or someone will do something about it. But it might be different true for everyone's life experience is rich and reflection emerging as ideas will for sure have clues to the treasure it encompasses. If at the end of the book if our reader has felt connected to some of the ideas listed or some of the ideas that emerged, we believe we have done some justice to our efforts of writing one.

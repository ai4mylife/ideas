Once we have an idea, we need a powerful story to convey it across to our fans. The story should ideally be melt-in-the-mouth like good chocolate and should leave you asking for more. We haven't figured this out completely it but have made some honest attempts to get close. Rather than specifcy an empty template to give you an idea of what this kind of story writing would be, we have included a sample chapter below that builds on an idea. 

Take a look below and let us know if this lit up a few :sparkles: sparkles :sparkles: in you.
Enjoy!

My Want
I want to look fresh, energetic and different when I go to work or socialize.


My Behavior
I am Ravi. I buy a lot of clothes. I stock my clothes in various closets.
I get scolded for taking up too much space but that’s just me.


The question that haunts me!
Every day when going out to work or when we have a social occasion to attend, the question that haunts me the most is 

What would I wear?


What I see vs. what others see
I choose the best from my clothes collection and show up. 

That said, I have been told many times that I end up looking rather the same i.e. people tell me politely enough that I am always seen in my favorite shirt or top and my usual comfortable shoes.

Don’t get me wrong - I do wear pants!

What others see




What may be happening behind-the scenes?

There could be many reasons - some that could use a fix and others beyond any fix.

What could use a Fix
-- I may not know what all is there in the closet.
-- I am probably picking only those clothes that are in the most accessible areas.
-- I repeatedly wear clothes that I feel most comfortable in.
-- I don’t have a good sense to pair clothes.
-- There is no one available to give me recommendations on what to wear.

OR 
What is beyond any Fix
-- My family just wants me out of the house as quickly as possible.
-- I am just meeting the same people over and over again.

My Need

I badly need a caring assistant who can recommend dress choices that would make me look good at work and in social circles.




I’ve heard there’s this thing called Artificial Intelligence.

Humans have given up on me. What can AI do?




I am your AI assistant, the name is Frido!

Tell me about all the dresses you have. 
Take a picture everyday when you wear something. 
Take a picture when you buy a new one and add to your collection.

You may also confide in me how you felt wearing this dress and what people had to say about your dress. If it’s someone's birthday party you are attending or a wedding or a get together with your old buddies, you may tell me that too.

Stay with me for a few days and help me be your buddy. I will soon be able to help you when you need me the most.

Frido - So, it’s been a hectic 2 weeks that I have been learning about you. Let me try and help you today with your choice of clothes.

Ravi - So, how do I look?
Frido - Charming. That said, here’s something that could make you Prince Charming.


Ravi - Go on, tell me more.
Frido - Where are you headed today?
Ravi - I am going to a wedding anniversary of my office colleague.
Frido - Hmm, will there be more of your office colleagues there?
Ravi - Yes, of course.

Frido - In that case, perhaps you can wear this printed shirt instead of what you are wearing. I remember you went to an office lunch a week back where you were wearing this shirt.
Ravi - Huh! You remember that? Nice suggestion.
Frido - Sure and I would recommend pairing it with this pair of jeans that you bought last month but haven’t worn at all.
Ravi - Oh, I totally forgot about that. Sweet! Thank you Frido!
Frido - Have a lovely time! Don’t forget to tell me what people said about you, Prince Charming.

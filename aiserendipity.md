#AI Serendipity

Humans are social in nature. There is a constant need to connect with friends and have few moments exchanged. But due to busy schedules, we don’t know the context of their lives and we don't know whether we end up disturbing them. How can AI help for Serendipity?

The digital impression we leave often has signals about when we are occupied, and when we have many things in pipeline, when we are in routine, and the day when we become open to be disturbed. How these impressions can hold a key for “Serendipity”.

An intent is registered by a person A to reach a person B. On confirmation by the other person B, it’s put in a queue. 

Both contact A and B exchanges, when they might relatively be able to converse, how long they may want to converse, and what are the best times for them and by when they might want to see to it they have actually conversed. 

GIven this information the AI assistant can try to observe for next N days whether there is a “Serendipitous Moment ''. It can also say to actually recommend a different “Moment” as ask confirmation whether that would be okay for them. 

It can be like both person A and person B may be planning to watch a match and if that match has got cancelled due to rain, it's a “Serendipitous Moment” for them to converse. 

Serendipitous Moments in life are moments spent waiting, or moments due to a planned event got cancelled.
It can be either of the person may be waiting to pick up their children from sports coaching.
It can be a planned shopping event was postponed.
It can be a planned visit to parents who have dropped. 
It can be waiting moments in a friend's house where the friend is taking longer to return.
It can be a delayed flight.

Generally due to the nature of these Moments it's not conducive for humans to be productive to follow up on something for they may not be in a mood nor prepared to do. Such times it's often refreshing to connect with an inspiring friend.
